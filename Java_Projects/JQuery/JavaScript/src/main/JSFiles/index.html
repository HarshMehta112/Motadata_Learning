        <p>This is Harsh Mehta Wikipedia[note 3] is a multilingual free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a
            community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and using a wiki-based editing
            system
            called MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history.[3] It is consistently
            one of
            the
            10 most popular websites ranked by Similarweb and formerly Alexa; as of 2023, Wikipedia was ranked the 5th
            most
            popular site in the world according to Semrush.[4] It is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American
            non-profit
            organization funded mainly through donations.

            Wikipedia has been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage,
            unique
            structure, culture, and reduced degree of commercial bias. It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic
            bias,
            particularly gender bias against women and ideological bias.[9][10] While the reliability of Wikipedia was
            frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise in the late 2010s
            and
            early
            2020s.[3][9][11] The website's coverage of controversial topics such as American politics and major events
            like
            the
            COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has received substantial media attention.[12][13][14]
            It
            has
            been censored by world governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site.[15][16] On 3 April 2018,
            Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake news by suggesting fact-checking links
            to
            related Wikipedia articles.[17][18] Articles on breaking news are often accessed as a source of frequently
            updated
            information about those events</p>

            Wikipedia was launched by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001. Sanger coined its name as a
            blend of
            wiki and encyclopedia. Wales was influenced by the "spontaneous order" ideas associated with Friedrich Hayek
            and
            the
            Austrian School of economics after being exposed to these ideas by the libertarian economist Mark
            Thornton.[5]
            Initially available only in English, versions in other languages were quickly developed. Its combined
            editions
            comprise more than 61 million articles, attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per month and more
            than
            15
            million edits per month (about 5.7 edits per second on average) as of January 2023.[6][7] In 2006, Time
            magazine
            stated that the policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the "biggest (and perhaps best)
            encyclopedia in
            the world".[8]
